351 stars
results from our automated survey of stellar flares using the entire Kepler dataset. Matching our flare stars to Kepler rotation periods, we find a decline in the energy emitted in flares as stars spin down. For a subset of Kepler M dwarfs with low resolution followup spectra, we also find a correlation between Halpha luminosity and the energy emitted in flares. These two results give the first definitive evidence of flare rates declining over stellar time, indicating flares are intimately connected to age--rotation--activity evolution of the global stellar dynamo.

\section{Introduction}

Surface magnetic activity is observed to decline over time for low-mass stars on the main sequence. Magnetic activity comes in a wide range of observable phenomena, including UV and X-ray luminosity, cool starspots, and flares. 
As the star loses angular momentum via stellar winds, the rotation velocity decreases and the internal magnetic dynamo is quieted. This age--activity connection was outlined in the seminal work by \citet{skumanich1972}, which was directly connected with flare activity as well \citep{skumanich1986}. Magnetic activity evolution has been confirmed and updated for low-mass stars (late F through early M type) in many studies using X-ray luminosity \citep{wright2011}, UV emission \citep{shkolnik2014}, Zeeman-Doppler imaging \citep{vidotto2014}, and H$\alpha$ emission \cite{west2015}, to name but a few. 


This surface activity can have significant impact on the evolution of habitable zone planets orbiting active stars. Flares in particular have been studied as a possible threat to a planet's ability to retain a habitable atmosphere \citep[e.g.][]{segura2010,luger2015,tilley2017}. For example, UV flux and high energy particles impacting a terrestrial planet's atmosphere from frequent stellar flares can significantly deplete ozone, and result in a potentially uninhabitable planetary surface \citep{tilley2017}. Under more extreme scenarios, stellar activity could strip large portions of a planet's atmosphere away over timescales of a few 100 Myr \citep{luger2015}. The duration of high flare activity early in a star's life may therefore be a fundamental property in defining potential planetary habitability. 


Stellar activity also makes planet searches more difficult, adding both slow variability (e.g. starspots) that can impact radial velocity studies, and fast stochastic variability (e.g. flares) that can impede transit searches \citep[e.g.][]{kipping2017}. Further, though stellar activity is less prominent at redder wavelengths, even observing in the infrared does not eliminate the potential for flares from active stars to impact transit searches, particularly for the lowest mass stars \citep{davenport2017a}. To understand planet occurrence rates for nearby low-mass stars, as well as the evolution of planetary habitability, we must constrain flare rates and properties as a function of stellar age.


Measuring the evolution of flare activity with stellar age has typically been limited to comparisons between flare stars in young clusters or stellar associations with known ages. Studying flare stars in young nearby moving groups and clusters reaches back at least five decades \citep{haro1966}, with the conclusion that all low-mass dwarf stars undergo an evolution in flare activity \citep{ambartsumian1975}. Pre-main sequence stars have also been known to exhibit high levels of flare activity compared to field-aged dwarfs \citep[e.g.][]{feigelson2001}. However, in most previous studies field stars are assumed to be approximately Solar-aged, and therefore generally flare-inactive, since few reliable age indicators for isolated field stars exist.


Space-based exoplanet transit missions such as \Kepler \citep{borucki2010} have provided a revolutionary dataset for statistical studies of flare stars, particularly for field dwarfs \citep{walkowicz2011}. Such missions are ideally suited for large scale studies of flares, as they produce high precision, continuous light curves for months to years in duration.
The \Kepler survey has been used to explore ``super-flare'' activity (events with energies more than 10 times larger than those observed on the Sun) from solar-mass stars \citep{shibayama2013}, as well as from K and M dwarfs \citep{candelaresi2014}. White-light flares in \Kepler light curves have been detected across the main sequence, from massive A and F stars \citep{balona2012} down to L dwarfs \citep{gizis2013}, and produced the most detailed catalogs of flares for individual active stars to date \citep{hawley2014,davenport2014b}. 


In this paper we present an ensemble analysis of flare activity in the \Kepler field, based on the flare sample amassed in \citet{davenport2016}. This sample was generated using an automated processing of the entire \Kepler light curve database, and produced a sample of over 4000 candidate flare stars. The \citet{davenport2016} catalog of flares provides the most complete census of flare activity from a large sample of field stars to date, and is the ideal dataset to study the evolution of flare rates with stellar age.


Here we explore the relationship between flare occurrence rates and stellar ages (derived from rotation periods) for stars in the \Kepler field. Our sample of flare stars with measured rotation periods is detailed in \S\ref{sec:sample}.
We present three approaches for quantitatively tracing changes in flare activity over time, including modeling the flare frequency distribution as a function of both stellar mass and age in \S\ref{sec:activity}. In \S\ref{sec:model} we explore the empirical evolution of flare activity for our \Kepler sample, and provide an analytic prescription for use in other studies. Finally, a short discussion and comparison to other studies is given in \S\ref{sec:discussion}.

\section{Flare Sample}
\label{sec:sample}

Our sample of flare stars comes from the automated search of \Kepler light curves from \citet{davenport2016}. This study produced the most comprehensive analysis of the \Kepler field for stellar flares, processing every short (1-minute) and long (30-minute) cadence light curve in search of flares. \citet{davenport2016} produced an open-source Python flare analysis codebase named {\tt appaloosa}, designed to detrend (model) \Kepler light curves of both instrumental and astrophysical noise, detect flare candidates (positive, significant outliers), and determine the reliability of the detected flares via artificial flare injection and recovery tests. These completeness tests were run on each continuous local segment of light curve available for every star, resulting in variable completeness limits for each star as the light curve noise properties change. \citet{davenport2016} made both the {\tt appaloosa} code, and the code to generate the figures and results in the paper available online. The results presented in this paper directly extend the work of \citet{davenport2016}, and so we also make our analysis code available as an update to the {\tt appaloosa} project online.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jradavenport/appaloosa}}


The \citet{davenport2016} sample of potential \Kepler flare stars required that within all available data for each star at least 100 candidate flares of any energy, and 10 flares with energies above the 68\% completeness threshold determined by the automated flare injection tests, be recovered. These conservative thresholds potentially could eliminate stars with fewer significant flares from our analysis, as noted by \citet{van-doorsselaere2017}. In \S\ref{sec:activity} and \S\ref{sec:model} we use both a sample of flare stars that pass these cut established by \citet{davenport2016}, and a sample that have no flare event thresholds. The latter is important for exploring the evolution of flare rates down to very low activity states, and indeed for considering null detections appropriately. Note also that stars with no flare event detections by {\tt appaloosa} will still have upper-limits on their flare detectability from the artificial injection tests.



Since we are focused here on quantifying the changes of flare activity with stellar age, we limit our analysis to stars with measured rotation periods. This is so we can use stellar rotation period as a proxy for age. We note that while the rotation--age connection may be more complex than most gyrochronology prescriptions, e.g. the weakened rotational braking found in Solar-age stars from \citet{van-saders2016}, rotation nonetheless increases continuously with age (i.e. stars nominally do not speed up while on the main sequence). Rotation is therefore a good means to {\it sort} stars by their age, even if the specific age derived from gyrochronology relations is not accurate. Our work here is further insulated from these effects, as the sample of flare star candidates from \citet{davenport2016} predominantly have rotation ages of $\lesssim 1$ Gyr. We specifically adopt for our analysis the rotation period catalog of \citet{mcquillan2014}, which derived 34,040 periods from \Kepler data using the Autocorrelation Function, and did extensive testing against other period-finding approaches such as the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram. 


The \citet{davenport2016} sample of $\sim$4,000 candidate flare stars contains several types of contamination from variable stars that do not exhibit flaring activity. For example, we found some eclipsing binaries and pulsating stars were able to fool the {\tt appaloosa} code, due to sharp features in their light curve, particularly at the 30-minute cadence. The worst cases of this failure appear to be caused by insufficient modeling of periodic signals by {\tt appaloosa}, namely by using too few sine curves to fit each significant period found and leaving sharp or peaky structures in the model residuals. Future versions of {\tt appaloosa} will improve on this detrending algorithm, and we urge caution when adopting the \citet{davenport2016} flare sample blindly. Our analysis is largely free from such contamination, as we require each star to have an identified rotation period by \citet{mcquillan2014}, who rejected such eclipsing and pulsating targets.



In Figure \ref{fig:ffd1} we show light curves and cumulative flare frequency distributions for three example flare stars from the \citet{davenport2016} sample that also have rotation periods measured in \citet{mcquillan2014}. These example stars will be followed through the analysis of the paper, and were selected to demonstrate a range of flare rates and rotation periods. In total we study the flare rate evolution from 3XX stars with rotation periods from \citet{mcquillan2014} that pass the \citet{davenport2016} flare selection criteria. We also analyze 2Y,YYY stars with rotation periods that were searched for flares, some with marginal levels of flare activity.

%all stars from Amy's sample included. this gives us NNN stars with good flare detections from D16 in the McQ sample, and YYY stars from that sample that were searched for flares but not found significantly flaring.

\section{Quantifying Flare Activity}
\label{sec:activity}


This requires a comparison of flare activity between stars of different masses and ages, as well as at different distances.
Our discussion in many ways mirrors the review on flare activity by Appendix A of \citet{kunkel1975}, which explored two different methods for quantifying and comparing flare activity from heterogeneous photometric studies: the integral of the light curve, and the rate at a given specific energy level




how do you really measure the ``activity'' level of a star via flares? Other magnetic activity indicators like H$\alpha$ or X-ray flux measure the filling factor (or density) of the chromosphere or corona, which is driven by B fields. (check NLDS, get wording SLH-approved). while flares occur stochastically, their overall rate and maximum intensity is related to the global B field since the energy of specific events traces the small-scale B fields of active regions.

In this section we outline three methods for quantifying the flare activity level of a star. These include the fractional flare energy ($L_{fl}/L_{Kp}$) used in D16 and introduced by \citet{lurie2015}, the flare rate evaluated at a specific energy, and an analytic model of the entire flare frequency distribution as a function of both stellar mass and age. While all three of these metrics has utility, we believe the latter will be of most value to investigations of habitability.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Fractional Flare Luminosity}
\label{sec:fracL}

discuss $L_{fl}/L_{Kp}$, originally developed by \citet{lurie2015} in their analysis of \Kepler data for the M5+M5 active binary, GJ 1245AB.
effectively the integral of the light curve, as \citet{kunkel1975} puts it

also recently used by \citet{yang2017}

this quantity is inspired by the  $L_{H\alpha}/L_{bol}$ for M dwarfs in giving the fractional luminosity of the emission in the chromosphere. The Halpha is done by measuring the equivalent width of Halpha, and then transforming to absolute units using the ``$\chi$'' factor that is spectral type dependent \citep{walkowicz2004}, or equivalently photometric color dependent \citep{douglas2016}.  By summing the equivalent duration for all observed flares we compute $L_{fl}/L_{Kp}$, analogous to integrating the Halpha line into equivalent width. Like the Halpha work, this also does not require accurate distance estimates for each star.


As \citet{lurie2015} note, the \Kepler figure needs to be corrected  by a $\chi$-like figure to compare between stars if differing spectral type. This value would compute the bolometric flux correction through the \Kepler bandpass as a function of spectral type. 
use bolometric magnitudes from Legget+1996? good discussion in \citet{douglas2016} about doing this carefully with model spectra as mean flux in 2 windows, which should be useful. If we assume a ``gray'' response (no intrinsic shape to the flare SED), then this correction factor is as simple as creating the ratio of $f_{obs} / f_{bol}$, directly equivalent to the $\chi$ factor.  In this case, the very wide bandpass of the \Kepler filter means the $\chi$ factor is relatively close to 1, and doesn't change much between spectral types. We demonstrate this in Figure \ref{fig:chi}, using the outputs for a 600 Myr PARSEC isochrone from \citet{bressan2012}.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figures/flare_chi}
\caption{
an approximation of the flare $\chi$, the correction factor that can be used to convert the observed fractional flare energy  $L_{fl}/L_{Kp}$ in to the metric for comparing between stars of different masses, $L_{fl}/L_{bol}$. This $\chi$ was computed using the bolometric and \Kepler absolute magnitudes from a 600Myr PARSEC isochrone \citep{bressan2012}. Here we show this correction factor versus $g-i$ color as a proxy for mass.
}
\label{fig:chi}
\end{figure}


However, an added complication is that while H$\alpha$ emission occurs over a fairly small range of wavelength, flares emit energy over all observed wavelengths. The shape of this emission in optical wavelengths is typically characterized as a hot blackbody, usually with $T_{eff}\approx10,000$ K, but has been seen to have significant excess emission in both the blue and red \citep[e.g. see][]{kowalski2013}. However, this temperature changes throughout the event in a manner that is often not well characterized, particularly for complex, multi-peaked flare events \citep[e.g.][]{slhadleo,kowalski2012}. thus the contrast between flare and quiescent emission is dependent on both the stellar spectrum and the flare temperature profile. Kowalski citation for detailed work on building a real flare SED in the optical, which might be promising way forward. 



the fractional flare energy was used in D16 to show that the flare activity level decreased with increasing Rossby number (decreasing rotation velocity), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:rossby1}.
{\bf TO DO: Make another version of this figure but correct to Lfl/Lbol.}

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figures/Rossby_lfllkp_color}
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{figures/color_rot_lfllkp}
\caption{
Rossby number vs flare energy for sample from Paper 1
}
\label{fig:rossby1}
\end{figure}

other complications for this quantity include varying distances, giving different energy ranges over which flares can be observed. For stars of similar distances this is negligible (GJ 1245AB being ideal). so given the energy range details, and flare temperature profile evolution uncertainties, this quantity is difficult to model with any precision. 




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Specific Flare Rate}
\label{sec:rate}

instead of integrating all flares, one can utilize their cumulative flare frequency vs energy distribution (FFD), and evaluate it at a fixed energy. this is appealing because the FFD is the typical figure of merit for considering a flare rate, and has been used in some capacity for many years \citep[e.g.][]{lme1976}, was noted as an option in D16 for effectively comparing flare activity levels for stars at different distances. for each star we can compute this by creating the FFD over whatever range of flares was actually observed, regardless of SpT or distance. note this is a reverse cumulative distribution, meaning the specific rates derived are for flares of a certain energy {\it or larger}. this FFD can be fit with a powerlaw function, and then a flare rate is read off the powerlaw function at a fixed energy for all stars.

In Figure \ref{fig:rossby2} we demonstrate the flare rate evaluated at an energy of $\log \varepsilon = 35$ erg, written as $R_{35}$, again versus the Rossby number. A clear gradient in the implied flare rate is seen as a function of mass, reproducing the previously known fact that while low-mass stars have a high flare rate and can emit a large fraction of their luminosity in flares, the actual flares are relatively lower energy. 

This is a good metric for comparing the flare rate of objects within a narrow range of temperature or spectral type, but whose distances and therefore flare energy sensitivity ranges are vastly different. Also good for compressing flare data into a single number that makes use of all flares in FFD.


\begin{figure}[!t]

}
\label{fig:rossby2}
\end{figure}


A similar approach is to pick a flare energy to evaluate the FFD fit that scales with the bolometric luminosity of the star. A flare event with an equivalent duration of $P=1$ sec by definition has an energy equal to the bolometric luminosity of the star integrated for 1 second
In Figure X we show the flare rate evaluated at an energy of $P=1$ sec, written as $R_{1s}$, versus the Rossby number.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Modeling the Flare Frequency Distribution}
\label{sec:ffd}

Rather than reducing the entire observed sample of flares for a given star down to a single metric, we can instead characterize the flare frequency distribution. the model would produce the mean, or expected, flare frequency distribution for all stars  at any age, mass, flare energy.
this good because FFD is, again, the figure of merit when discussing solar and stellar flare rates. this also good b/c allows us to compare flare energy distributions between stars of different masses, or distances (changes observable energy range).


In Figure \ref{fig:meanffd} we show the FFD for our sample of NNN stars with measured rotation periods and good flare rates, separated into six bins based on their $g-i$ colors. Thus the stars within each bin have roughly similar masses, {\bf ranging from M=1.1 to M=0.3?}. Each FFD shown is actually the mean FFD for a single star, averaged over all available qtrs of \Kepler data.
Each FFD is colored by the rotation period reported by \citet{mcquillan2014}, with increasing rotation periods from red to blue.
a very clear trend in the flare frequency versus rotation periods is seen, with flare rates monotonically deceasing as stars lose angular momentum. Stars of higher mass have higher energy flares recovered, since the star is intrinsically brighter and a given fractional amplitude of flux corresponds to larger luminosity increase. the low-energy cutoff in each FFD is determined by the flare injection tests of D16. A bias is seen where rapid rotators have slightly higher energy cutoffs, due to increased starspot amplitudes that make flare recovery more difficult for the iterative algorithm of D16.
Since colors of stars are in small bins, the energy zeropoints used to transform relative EDs into energies have very small differences. these FFDs show that the flare rate model idea empirically works.



For each star, need to convert the observed units (color, period) in to theoretical units (mass, age)
color into mass via isochrone in D16.  problems here, of course. new version of KIC stats (Stellar-17) provides another way to test this. our masses generally good. very few potential giants in our final sample of rotating stars {\bf CHECK Stellar-17 vs final sample}

age via gyro prescriptions (ruth, etc). problems may exist at older, slower rotators \citep{van-saders2016}, but our sample of flare stars mostly biased towards more active, younger stars.



%will Jen van Saders have new gyro stuff out i can use?
%this is the big plot i want this paper to be all about. even if i make it a few times with diff age metrics




{\bf null detections.... figure those out}




we assume powerlaw decrease in FFD evolution. this not totally absurd, since other activity indicators have similar form, including the relative flare luminosity observed in D16.
We have used the following model to fit the FFD evolution:

\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eqn:model}
& \log \nu = a \log \varepsilon + b\\
a =& a_1 \log t + a_2 m + a_3 \nonumber\\
b =& b_1 \log t + b_2 m + b_3 \nonumber % \log t \, m + b_4
\end{eqnarray}

\noindent
where $\varepsilon$ is the flare energy in erg, $t$ is the stellar age in Myr, $m$ is the stellar mass relative to Solar, and the resulting $\nu$ is the cumulative number of flares per day. we fit this first with a least-sq approach {\bf(implement BSFG-S)}, and then run model with a MCMC {\bf(implement MCMC - add MCMC analysis figures)}. The final parameters in our model are given in Table \ref{tbl:params}.

we tried other parameterization of the model, including a 4th term (cross term), but the BIC wasn't better enough to warrant the increase in the degrees of freedom. Figure \ref{fig:chisq} shows no strong trend in the quality of the model versus either color or period: a reasonable fit all over.

For stars bluer stars, however, a modest trend is present, which may indicate a higher order fit is required to trace the evolution for Solar mass stars.

now that we've fit all the FFDs together, we can go back and predict the FFDs in our sample to demonstrate the model is working for specific targets. For example, same targets as before are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ffdmodel}, with model fits.

%Height should be easy enough, just use distance I'm assuming from isochrone fits
%
%Similar finding to \citet{kowalski2009} and \citet{hilton2010} for flare stars being more confined to the galactic plane than ``active'' stars (measured from H$\alpha$.) This is consistent with model of flares being sensitive to rotation {\it earlier}, this flare activity dropping sooner in a stars life (lower scale height in Galaxy), and thus a break from saturation at smaller Rossby Number

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

this is the first time a direct connection between stellar flare energy and other traditional magnetic activity indicators has been determined, tying the occurrence of flares on small size scales to the total chromospheric activity of the star.


flares in clusters not analyzed here, but basically no flares observed in original \Kepler cluster sample

could flares be an important piece of the lower stellar atmosphere? models of ellerman bombs, etc \citep[e.g.][]{hansteen2017}. \Kepler cannot see flares small enough in energy. However, if the nano/micro-flare rate evolves coherantly with the large/super-flare rates observed here, this atmospheric support mechanism must change.
